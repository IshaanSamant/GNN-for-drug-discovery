# GNN-for-drug-discovery
A new type of GNN implemented for drug discovery, this GNN uses attention which makes the information aggregation process more effcient and ensures each node gets useful information.

The advantage of the attention mechanism is two-fold, first of all the computations only need to be performed on the important parts of the drug and secondly the other important part 
is that the attention mechanism is able to idenfity which parts of the drug are important and change them accordingly.
